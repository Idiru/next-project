## üß© Implementation Summary

### Redux Slice

- A dedicated slice was created to manage the Pok√©mon list.
- `createAsyncThunk` handles the asynchronous API call.
- The slice manages loading, success, and error states.
- Data is typed with TypeScript.

### TypeScript Integration

- Defined types for `PokemonSummary` and the API response.
- The slice state is typed using a `PokemonState` interface.
- `RootState` and `AppDispatch` are exported to ensure fully typed Redux usage.

### Store Configuration

- All reducers are registered in the central `store.ts` file.
- Store types are exported for reuse throughout the app.

### Redux Provider

- A custom `ReduxProvider` wraps the application.
- Integrated into `layout.tsx` so the Redux store is available globally.

### Custom Hooks

- `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` were created for type-safe Redux usage.

### Pages
- The `Home` which is displaying the list of Pokemons
- The `PokemonDetailPage` which is displaying the detail of Pokemon after clicking on a `PokemonBlock`, the content of this page dynamically generated thanks an API done with the parameter `name` inside the url

### Component Usage

- The `fetchPokemonList` action is dispatched in a `useEffect` on mount.
- The `PokemonList` to get the list of Pokemons 
- The `PokemonBlock` mapped inside the `PokemonList` to display each Pokemon, to click on it redirect to the related Pokemon detail page
- Loading and error states are displayed in the UI.
