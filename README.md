## üß© Implementation Summary

### 1. Redux Slice

- A dedicated slice was created for managing the Pok√©mon list.
- Uses `createAsyncThunk` to handle the asynchronous API call.
- Manages loading, success, and error states.
- The data is typed using TypeScript interfaces.

### 2. TypeScript Integration

- Defined types for `PokemonSummary` and API response structure.
- The slice state is typed (`PokemonState`) for better reliability.
- `RootState` and `AppDispatch` are exported to ensure typed Redux hooks.

### 3. Store Configuration

- All reducers are registered in the central `store.ts` file.
- Store types are exported to be used throughout the app.

### 4. Redux Provider

- A custom `ReduxProvider` wraps the application.
- Integrated into `layout.tsx` to make the store available globally.

### 5. Custom Hooks

- `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` were created for type-safe usage of Redux in components.

### 6. Component Usage

- `fetchPokemonList` is dispatched in a `useEffect` to trigger the API call on mount.
- Loading and error states are handled in the UI.
- Pok√©mon are displayed as a bullet-point list using Tailwind CSS (`list-disc`, `pl-6`).
